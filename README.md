Unique Value Tester
===================

## How the algorithm works:
Set first item in list as item to check.
Remove first item in list.
Go through list removing any instances of item to check.
If reach end of list without removing any items item must be unique.
If removed item from list then repeat from new first item.

## Limitations:
Input must only have one unique item.
If there is more than one unique item it will return the first item.

It is left as an exercise for the reader to enhance the code to return all
unique values.
