Set first item in list as item to check
Remove first item in list
Go through list removing any instances of item to check
If reach end of list without removing any items item must be unique

Limitations:
Input must only have one unique item
If there is more than one unique item it will return the first item

It is left as an exercise for the reader to enhance the code to return all
unique values.
